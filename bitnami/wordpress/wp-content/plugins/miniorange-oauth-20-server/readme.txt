You can checkout the below video tutorial to know how to setup SSO with your OAuth/OpenID Compliant Applications.

https://youtu.be/c6v-SqRhg8o

Basically, the OAuth Server plugin allows users to login into applications that are OAuth 2.0 compliant, using their WordPress login credentials. As it's name suggests, it follows the OAuth 2.0 protocol. Along with that, it also supports OpenID Connect (OIDC), and JWT protocols.

The primary goal of the OAuth Server plugin is to enable Single Sign On so that users do not need to remember username and password for each application.
Once Single Sign On is enabled, users do not need to store sensitive information to login into different applications.

**Discovery URL**
The discovery url / well-known endpoint can be used to get metadata about your Identity Server. It will return information about the OAuth/OpenID endpoints, issuer URL, supported grant types, supported scopes, key material along with claims in the JSON format. These details can be used by the clients to create an OpenID server request. The well known configuration URL is accessible via /.well-known/openid-configuration, in relation to the issuer URL.

**JWT Token Verification**
JWT signing enables the token's recipient to confirm that the token actually received includes all of the information encoded by the issuer in its original, unaltered form.

HS256, a symmetric signature algorithm, indicates that the signature is generated and verified using the same secret key. It is supported in the free version of the plugin.

RS256, an asymmetric signature algorithm is different from a symmetric algorithm in that a pair of private and public keys is used to sign and validate the data respectively instead of a single secret key.

**Why RSA algorithm should be used?**
The use of a public and private key pair makes RS256 more secure in comparison to HS256 where the public key is shared and might be compromised whereas in RS256, even if you do not have the control over your client, your data remains secure as it is signed using a private key. The premium version of the plugin supports the RS256 algorithm.

**Postman collection**
Postman collection JSON is a file that can be used for testing the configuration of OAuth 2.0 flow in the WP OAuth Server plugin without configuring an external OAuth Client by generating the access token and the API call to the resource endpoint subsequently.

= WORDPRESS OAUTH / OPENID CONNECT SERVER USE CASES =
* If you want to use your WordPress site as an Identity Server / OAuth Server / OAuth Provider and use WordPress user's login credentials to login into your client site / application then you can use this plugin. You can also decide what kind of User data / attributes you want to send while Single Sign On into your client site / application.
* If you want to login to your Mobile app / Single Page web app (SPA) using your WordPress credentials, then you can use the Authorization code with PKCE flow grant type to achieve your use case.
* Single set of credentials will be used to login to multiple WordPress websites.
* You can access the NGINX resources using NGINX Authentication. Once you login into your client application using WP OAuth Server credentials, you will get JWT. Your client application can further use it for NGINX Authentication. 
* Membership sync or role mapping is used to sync the memberships or roles assigned to your users from OAuth Server to OAuth/OpenID Client.
* Custom Attribute Mapping is useful if you want to send any additional attributes (other than the default ones) from your WordPress <em>usermeta</em> table to your OAuth/OpenID Client.

A grant is a method of acquiring an access token. Deciding which grants to implement depends on the type of client the end user will be using, and the experience you want for your users.

= WE SUPPORT FOLLOWING GRANTS: =
* **Authorization code grant** : This code grant is used when there is a need to access the protected resources on behalf of the user on another third party application.
* **Implicit grant** : This grant relies on resource owner and registration of redirect uri. In authorization code grant users need to ask for authorization and access token each time, but here access token is granted for a particular redirect uri provided by a client using a particular browser.
* **Client credential grant** : This grant type heads towards specific clients, where access token is obtained by client by only providing client credentials. This grant type is quite confidential.
* **Resource owner password credentials grant** : This type of grant is used where the resource owner has a trust relationship with the client. Just by using username and password, provided by resource owner authorization and authentication can be achieved.
* **Refresh token grant** : Access tokens obtained in OAuth flow eventually expire. In this grant type client can refresh his or her access token.
* **Authorization code grant with PKCE flow** : This grant type is used for public clients like mobile and native apps, Single Page web apps, where there is a risk of client secret being compromised.

= REST API AUTHENTICATION =
Rest API is very much open to interact. Creating posts, getting information of users and much more is readily available.
It secures unauthorized access to your WordPress sites/pages using our <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rest-api-authentication/" target="_blank"> WordPress REST API Authentication plugin </a>.

== Installation ==

= From your WordPress dashboard =
1. Visit `Plugins > Add New`
2. Search for `OAuth 2.0 server`. Find and Install `OAuth 2.0 server`
3. Activate the plugin from your Plugins page

= From WordPress.org =
1. Download OAuth 2.0 server.
2. Unzip and upload the `miniorange-oauth-login` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate miniOrange OAuth from your Plugins page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I need to customize the plugin or I need support and help? =
Please email us at info@xecurify.com or <a href="http://miniorange.com/contact" target="_blank">Contact us</a>. You can also submit your query from plugin's configuration page.
